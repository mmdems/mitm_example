Project was implemented to understand processes of packet sniffing at low-level of ISO/OSI model
System contains 2 SC FIFOs. Of course real systems DC FIFOs. But it's just prototype

With help of this system you can:
* listen the channel
* add some user packets with determined data insdide
* check CRC32 of packet going through the channel
* kill any packet
* fix data of any packet
